However, there are large discrepancies between the NME values provided by different methods. In this paper we propose a statistical analysis of the 48Ca 0νββ NME using the interacting shell model, emphasizing the range of the NME probable values and its correlations with observables that can be obtained from the existing nuclear data. Based on this statistical analysis with three independent effective Hamiltonians we propose a common probability distribution function for the 0νββ NME, which has a range of (0.45 - 0.95) at 90\\% confidence level of, and a mean value of 0.68.","pptname":"2023-3-737213466-journal-club20220905.pdf","id":21}
