Based on the universal PC-PK1 density functional, the energies of the yrast states with spin up to 20ℏand the available B(E2) transition probabilities are well reproduced. The yrast states are predicted to be of four-quasiparticle structure above spin I = 16ℏ. The inclusion of the time-odd interactions increases the kinetic moments of inertia and delays the appearance of the first band crossing, and, thus, improves the description of the data.\r\n\r\n","pptname":"2025-12-152289705-jc_yli_20251210.pdf","id":80}
