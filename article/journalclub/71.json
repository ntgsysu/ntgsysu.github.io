We carefully examine 2νββ matrix elements within the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation with nuclear energy density functionals. We work with functionals that are fit globally to single-beta-decay half-lives and charge-exchange giant-resonance energies, but not to 2νββ half-lives themselves, to evaluate the 2νββ nuclear matrix elements for all important nuclei, including those whose half-lives have not yet been measured. Such a comprehensive evaluation in large model spaces without configuration truncation requires an efficient computational scheme; we employ a double contour integration within the finite amplitude method. The results generally reproduce the nuclear matrix element extracted from half-lives well, without the use of any of those half-lives in the fitting procedure. We present predictions of the matrix elements in a total of 27 nuclei with half-lives that are still unmeasured.","pptname":"","id":71}
