The numerical accuracy and stability of the FAM–RQRPA is tested in a calculation of the monopole response of 22O. As an illustrative example, the model is applied to a study of the evolution of monopole strength in the chain of Sm isotopes, including the splitting of the giant monopole resonance in axially deformed systems.","pptname":"","id":30}
