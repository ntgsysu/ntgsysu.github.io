In this Letter, we report the first-ever calculation of a NSM in a nuclear ab initio framework, employing the no-core shell model to study the fluorine isotope 19F. We further perform quantum-chemistry calculations to evaluate the sensitivity of the hafnium monofluoride cation, HfF+, to the NSM of 19F. Combined with recent high-precision measurements of the molecular electric dipole moment of HfF+, our results enable the first experimental bound on the NSM of 19F.","pptname":"2025-8-844597468-JC-2025-8-2.pdf","id":72}
