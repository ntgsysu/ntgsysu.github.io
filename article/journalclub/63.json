Our analyses reveal the prevalence of multiquasiparticle prolate and broken-pair triaxial structures in even-even osmium isotopes\r\n(N = 112–118) and N = 116 isotones (Z = 72–80). In addition, our exploration of N = 116 isotones identifies potential isomeric states, systematically, including noncollective 10− and collective 12+ states, constructed upon specific neutron configurations.","pptname":"2025-4-410000296-journal_club-_Runyan-Dong.pdf"}
