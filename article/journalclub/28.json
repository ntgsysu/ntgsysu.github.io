In the present work, we clarify the conditions of the exactness of quadratures in the projection method. For efficient computation, the Lebedev quadrature and spherical t-design are introduced to the angular-momentum projection. The accuracy of the quadratures is discussed in comparison with the conventional Gauss-Legendre and trapezoidal quadratures. We found that the Lebedev quadrature is the most efficient among them and the necessary number of sampling points for the quadrature, which is often proportional to the computation time, is reduced by a factor 2/3 in comparison with the conventional method.","pptname":"2023-3-601593349-journal-club20221107.pdf","id":28}
