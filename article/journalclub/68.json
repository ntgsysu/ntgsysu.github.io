This procedure, based on the proper definition of a natural basis of orthonormal states, does not require the evaluation of the non-diagonal Hamiltonian kernels to do the selection and helps to reduce the numerical instabilities. The performance of the method is analyzed in detail in the ground state and 0+ excited states of some selected nuclei computed with the Gogny energy density functional.","pptname":"2025-5-280620592-JC_lyh.pptx"}
