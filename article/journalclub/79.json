The associated EFT truncation uncertainty for these potentials is difficult to quantify. We use singular values decompositions of low-resolution nuclear forces to obtain an operator basis to study Hamiltonian uncertainties for these potentials. We perform Bayesian inference for the singular values and three-body low-energy constants, the free parameters of nuclear Hamiltonians in our framework, using likelihoods based on nucleon-nucleon phase shifts and triton observables to account for the EFT truncation uncertainties in these quantities. We propagate the resulting distribution of Hamiltonians forward to predictions for ground-state properties of \r\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline-block\"><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mn>24</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>28</mn></mrow></msup><mtext>O</mtext></math>\r\nand \r\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline-block\"><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mn>48</mn></mrow></msup><mtext>Ca</mtext></math>, comparing against other state-of-the-art nuclear structure predictions. Our approach makes it possible to account for EFT uncertainties when using low-resolution potentials, which is important for many ongoing studies in exotic nuclei.","pptname":"2025-12-484728395-2025JournalClub(SRGUncertainty)-CRD.pdf"}
