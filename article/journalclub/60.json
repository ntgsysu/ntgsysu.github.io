However, there is some disagreement on the value of the half-life. In a new measurement we have determined this quantity to be 𝑇1/2=17.2832±0.005⁢1(stat)±0.006⁢6(syst)s, which differs from the previous world average by 3 standard deviations. The impact of this measurement on limits for physics beyond the standard model such as the presence of tensor currents is discussed.","pptname":"2025-4-225726981-20250402yxzhang.pdf","id":60}
