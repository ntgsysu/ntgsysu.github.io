Here, we use the ab initio no-core shell model framework to theoretically investigate the magnitude of the nuclear EDM. We calculate EDMs of several light nuclei using chiral two- and three-body interactions and a PT-violating Hamiltonian based on a one-meson-exchange model. We present a benchmark calculation for  3He , as well as results for the more complex nuclei  6,7 Li  ,  9Be ,10,11B ,13C,14,15N , and 19F  . Our results suggest that different nuclei can be used to probe different terms of the PT-violating interaction. These calculations allow us to suggest which nuclei may be good candidates in the search for a measurable permanent electric dipole moment.","pptname":"2026-1-236115410-JC-2026-1-7.pptx","id":81}
