Several formulas are used to obtain the binding energies and proton separation energies according to the shell-model calculations. The non-parametric Bootstrap method is applied to establish an uncer-tainty decomposition and recomposition framework. Moreover, it is used to estimate the stability of proton(s) emission for each nuclide. Two formulas for calculating the binding energies with a systematic uncertainty of ∼ 0.3 MeV are proposed, and a reliable extrapolation ability is examined. These binding energy formulas deduce similar forms of respective Sp and S2p energies, which predict the extension of the nuclear boundary of this region. A nice description of the binding energies and proton separation energies is provided. The one- and two-proton separation energies and partial half-lives of proton emitting are predicted, thus showing a new dripline. Besides, there are 30 un-stable nuclides predicted to be bound against proton(s)-emission. These nuclear properties will be useful in nuclear astrophysics.","pptname":"2023-3-503581236-journalclub2022-7-5.pdf","id":20}
