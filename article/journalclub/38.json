Using the ab initio in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG), we study ground-state energies and charge radii of closed-shell nuclei from 4He to 78Ni, based on a set of low-resolution two- and three-nucleon interactions that predict realistic saturation properties. We first investigate in detail the convergence properties of these Hamiltonians with respect to model-space truncations for both two- and three-body interactions. We find one particular interaction that reproduces well the ground-state energies of all closed-shell nuclei studied. As expected from their saturation points relative to this interaction, the other Hamiltonians underbind nuclei, but lead to a remarkably similar systematics of ground-state energies. Extending our calculations to complete isotopic chains in the sd and pf shells with the valence-space IM-SRG, the same interaction reproduces not only experimental ground states but two-neutron-separation energies and first excited 2+ states. We also calculate radii with the valence-space IM-SRG for the first time. Since this particular interaction saturates at too high density, charge radii are still too small compared with experiment. Except for this underprediction, the radii systematics is, however, well reproduced. Our results highlight the importance of nuclear matter as a theoretical benchmark for the development of next-generation chiral interactions.","pptname":"2023-6-104483193-JClub04242023_CCWang.pdf","id":38}
