This solves a long-standing problem in calculating states of good symmetry, arising from the sign ambiguity of the commonly used determinant formula. A simple example is given of projecting a good particle number and angular momentum from a Bogoliubov wave function in the Fock space of a single j-shell.","pptname":"","id":31}
