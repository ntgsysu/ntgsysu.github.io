After studying two toy problems, idential fermions with a contact interaction and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we employ the valence-space formulation of the IMSRG to investigate the even-A carbon isotopes with a chiral two-body potential. We find that retaining only those commutators expressions that scale as N7 provides an excellent approximation of the full three-body treatment.","pptname":"2024-12-935710227-1121_lhc_journalclub.pptx"}
