We perform large-scale shell-model calculations of the 129Xe and 199Hg nuclei with realistic effective teractions. To estimate the Schiff moments caused by the P,T-odd π NN interaction perturbatively, we employ the one-particle–one-hole approximation to the intermediate tates. The Schiff moments of 129Xe and 199Hg are reduced due to the configuration mixing by ∼10% from the evaluation of the independent particle model. On the other and, the reduction is more significant in mean-field based calculations and shell-model calculations with a drastic truncation. In order to resolve the discrepancy in the Schiff moment of 199Hg among several nuclear models, we survey low-energy nuclear structure. The large-scale shell-model calculations reveal that the Schiff moment of 199Hg is considerably quenched in the second (1/2) - state.","pptname":"","id":33}
