It turns out that, the form of the trial VAP wave function with spin J can be simplified by adopting just one projected state rather than previously adopting all （2J+1） angular momentum projected states for each selected reference state, |\\psi\\rangle\r\n. The present calculations show that such simplification still minimizes the angular momentum projected energy up to a very good approximation. In this simplified VAP scheme, one can obtain almost equivalent VAP wave functions starting from different sets of the projected basis states. This clearly shows that a nuclear state can not be identified with a single intrinsic state, while in the traditional nuclear collective models, an intrinsic state is usually assigned to a well deformed rotational band.","pptname":"2023-4-10394268-2023.3.26.pdf"}
